# TFVM - Terraform Version Manager
*A NodeJS-based CLI tool to manage terraform versions without needing admin access.*

This tool exists despite the existence of [tfswitch](https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/) and similar tools because we
needed a tool for managing Terraform versions on Windows that worked without needing
Administrator-level access. For convenience, we have also made this tool work
for Mac and Linux (though more testing with Linux would be greatly appreciated, as we've only tried it with WSL) as well
so that our trainings and documentation can expect the user to use this tool instead of one of the
many different tools that are available.

## See [the cli package README.md file](./packages/cli/README.md) for installation, usage, and troubleshooting information.
